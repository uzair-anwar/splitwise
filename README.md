## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm (>=7.x)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.sample` provided. This file should contain your Firebase configuration details:


## Adding a Router

Create React App doesn't prescribe a specific routing solution, but [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is the most popular one.

To add it, run:

```sh
npm install react-router-dom
```
### Material-UI

Material-UI is a widely-used UI component library for React that follows Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a set of pre-designed components and styles that enable developers to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces with ease.

### Adding Material-UI

To add [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) to your project, run the following npm command:

```sh
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

### Integrating Firebase DataBase

To integrate [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Create Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Get Configuration:** In your Firebase project settings, locate the web app configuration. You'll need the configuration object containing API keys, authentication settings, and other details.

3. **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and populate it with the Firebase configuration details, as shown in the `.env.sample` file.

4. **Installing Firebase:** Install the Firebase JavaScript SDK using the following npm command:

   ```sh
   npm install firebase


## Using Redux Toolkit for State Management

Redux Toolkit is a powerful library that simplifies the process of managing state in a React application. It provides utility functions and best practices that make it easier to write and maintain Redux code.

### Installation

To use Redux Toolkit in your Split Wise application, follow these steps:

1. Install Redux Toolkit and other dependencies:
   
   ```sh
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux


## Development

1. **Installing Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Running Development Server:**
